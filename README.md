## Foundry

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

- **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
- **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
- **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
- **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.

### ABOUT
This is a minimal project allowing users to fund the contract owner with donations. The smart contract accepts ETH as donations, denominated in USD. Donations have a minimal USD value, otherwise they are rejected. The value is priced using a Chainlink price feed, and the smart contract keeps track of doners in case they are to be rewarded in the future.
